Certainly! Let's reimagine the Hydration Reminder App using SwiftUI for watchOS.

1. **HydrationReminderView.swift**

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct HydrationReminderView: View {
    @State private var waterIntake: Double = 0
    let dailyGoal: Double = 2000 // in ml, e.g., 2 liters
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 16) {
            Text("Hydration Reminder")
                .font(.headline)

            Text("\(Int(waterIntake))ml / \(Int(dailyGoal))ml")
                .font(.title)

            ProgressView(value: waterIntake, total: dailyGoal)
            
            HStack {
                Button(action: {
                    waterIntake += 250
                }) {
                    Text("+250ml (Glass)")
                }

                Button(action: {
                    waterIntake += 500
                }) {
                    Text("+500ml (Bottle)")
                }
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

struct HydrationReminderView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        HydrationReminderView()
    }
}
```

2. **Notifications (Optional)**

To send periodic reminders to drink water, you'd want to use the `UserNotifications` framework to schedule local notifications. Ensure you handle the necessary permissions and settings.

3. **Digital Crown Integration (Optional)**

You can further enhance this with Digital Crown integration, allowing users to manually adjust their water intake using the crown.

4. **Complication**

To allow users a quick glance at their hydration progress, you can create complications for various watch faces using the `CLKComplicationDataSource` protocol.

Remember, when creating watchOS apps using SwiftUI, make sure you consider:

- The smaller display space.
- Ensure touch targets are easily tappable.
- Utilize Digital Crown for interactions when necessary.
- Test on different watch sizes to ensure a consistent user experience.

The above is a basic SwiftUI representation for a watchOS Hydration Reminder app. In a real-world scenario, you'd add more functionalities, graphics, error handling, and user preferences, and you'd also ensure the app meets Apple's guidelines for quality and user privacy before deploying.
